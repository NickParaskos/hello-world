Hello World!

I am currently a .NET student at Tech Elevator where I have experience in the .NET environment. I spent two years supervising and training 150 plus employees for a c-store retailer and for the past four years I have worked in a entrepreneurial capacity in the Real Estate Industry. Becoming a developer has interested me ever since I created my own website for my real estate business. That lead me to looking into FreeCodeCamp, and from there I took a javascript course on Udemy.I am looking to apply my previous leadership and business operations experience to join a team oriented company as I continue to grow as a developer.
